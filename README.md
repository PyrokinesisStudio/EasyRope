# Easy Rope
Easy Rope - an addon for Blender that lets you easily create hanging down ropes, wires, etc.

Watch demo-video here: 

## How to use:
1) Place the cursor to a point where you need to create the beginning of the rope, press Add point button
2) Place cursor and press Add point again (to create a rope you need to add at least 2 points), 
you can do it as many times as you need. In every such point your rope will be fixed
3) When you finish adding points, setup subdivision level for your rope, stiffness (the more value the less will the rope hang down)
4) If you will check Apply as shape key, rope will have a shape key and you will be able to control its hanging by that key
5) Setup whether your rope will be dynamic or static
6) Press Generate!
